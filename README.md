#  Rwanda Telecom Analysis (2000–2024)

## 1. Project Overview

This project explores the trends in internet usage and mobile cellular subscriptions in Rwanda between 2000 and 2024. It addresses a real-world problem in the **Telecommunication sector**, using public data and analytics to uncover patterns, identify growth, and forecast future developments.

The project combines **Python-based data analysis** with a **Power BI dashboard** to produce an insightful, interactive, and practical report useful for decision-makers and digital development advocates.

## 2. Instructions:

-Choose a real-world problem in one or more sectors (e.g., Health, Agriculture,
Education, etc.)
- Find or use an existing public dataset
- Conduct data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and basic modeling in Python
- Create a Power BI dashboard that explains findings clearly
- Present your work in a structured GitHub repository and PowerPoint file

## 3. Problem Statement

Despite significant growth in mobile and internet access in Rwanda, it's important to understand how these changes evolved over time and where gaps may still exist. This project investigates:

- How has access to digital services changed from 2000 to 2024?
- What are the key growth trends in mobile and internet adoption?
- How can future development be guided by historical data?

## 6. Project Structure

Your repository should follow this layout:

- `images/` – Screenshots from notebook and dashboard
-  `data/` – Raw CSV files downloaded from World Bank
- `notebooks/` – Python Jupyter Notebook used for data processing and analysis
- `powerbi/` – Power BI `.pbix` file for interactive dashboard
- `README.md` – Project documentation and instructions

---

## 7. Results Summary

- Internet usage rose from less than 1% in 2000 to over 34% in 2023
- Mobile cellular subscriptions grew from <1 per 100 people to over 91 per 100
- Linear regression confirmed a strong upward trend for both indicators
- Forecast models indicate continued growth through 2030

---

## 8. Recommendations

- Expand affordable access to digital services, especially in underserved areas
- Promote infrastructure investment in rural regions
- Encourage digital literacy programs to improve usage
- Use data insights to guide resource allocation for telecom development

---

## 9. Future Work

- Apply advanced forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet for more accurate predictions
- Compare Rwanda’s trends with other East African countries
- Integrate additional data such as GDP, education, or urbanization rates
- Build a live dashboard that connects to updated real-time data sources
